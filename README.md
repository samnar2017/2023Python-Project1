# 2023Python-Project1

the data

the goal of this project is to analyze student test performance

pick any school in this dataset as an initial comparison point

pick a feature/measure/score

compare above school to schools in the entire dataset, schools in a
particular borough, or schools in a particular district - you only need
to do one additional comparison point (but youâ€™re welcome to do
more comparisons if you feel compelled to do so)

the analysis should include some descriptive statistics

the analysis should include one cleaning task (or more)

the analysis should include one visualization (or more)
